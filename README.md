# Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### An application that determines a user’s age based on a planet’s solar years 5/31/19

#### By **Marissa Perry**

## Description

A website created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, and Webpacks That returns a users age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy.
If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.
